<h2>How to Participate</h2>

<p>There are many ways to participate in #maptimeDavis. Here are some suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Attend events.</b>  See below for the current #maptimeDavis Workshop Schedule.</li>
<li><b>Help at a workshop.</b> Making workshops run smoothly is a team effort. We often need folks to help answer questions, relay communications to the presenter, or help participants who get stuck.</li>
<li><b>Present a workshop.</b> You don't need to be an expert to teach well.</li>
<li><b>Join #maptimeDavis Council</b>, the group of people who organize each quarter's events.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please send questions to Michele Tobias - mmtobias@ucdavis.edu<p>
